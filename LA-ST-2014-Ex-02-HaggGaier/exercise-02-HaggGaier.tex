\section*{Conclusion}

After doing the assignment, and playing with machine learning we want to get a few of your thoughts. 

Where the assignment abstract began as a general summary of the topic, which you can use for your exam studying- the conclusion should be more specific to the course content. Feedback can be included here. Also I would like to know if there are any issues with the assignments. If you felt the assignment was \textbf{\hl{stupid}}, please write your arguments for here.  If you really want to get our attention, \hl{you should highlight your text} 

We want to make this course as applicable and useful as possible, and this can only be done with useful and continuous feedback. We are actively investigating the best tools for teaching machine learning. 

\section*{Sources}
Sources are expected. If you follow a tutorial online, used a stack overflow answer or github repo then list it here. Getting caught will result in trouble.

\section*{Appendix A: Code}

Once you've answered the assignment questions please include only relevant code snippets in the appendix. You're expected to submit full working source code with the assignments in a subdirectories of your zipped assignment folder. The bellow snippets are not really relevant, but I can't give out assignment solutions here.

\section*{Appendix B: Results}

Your results should be written in your assignment answers Images, Figures etc. should be included in this appendix. Use \LaTeX to properly refer to the correct figure if needed, same goes for code snippets. The assignment answers should discuss the results, we are interested in assessing your knowledge. If you're told to generate 10 figures from the same data set, you need to include all the figures in sub directories of your assignment zip folder, but you should only include in the appendix as many figures as needed to back up your answer.
